=========FIRST=========
Find pixels of defined color

Hought line detector 

INTERPOLATE PIXELS OVER DETECTED LINES (USE RoiFill)


=========SECOND=========
ASK USER TO DEFINE A REGION FOR SEARCH

DETECT A CONTOURS OVER SELECTED AREA (MAYBE IF AREA IS LESS THAN DEFINED CONST)

INTERPOLATE PIXELS OVER DETECTED LINES (USE RoiFill) WITH DIFFENT LAST ARGUMENT
UNTIL USER IS SATISFIED

=========THIRD=========
STORE FOUND LINES WITH HOUGHT IN BINARY Mat 

USE DILATION AND FINDING BIG ANOUGHT CONTOURS FOR CREATING A MASK
(http://opencvexamples.blogspot.com/2013/09/find-contour.html)

DELETE FALSE LINES WITH CREATED MASK

RUN A HOUGHT OVER A Mat WITH FILTERED LINES

INTERPOLATE PIXELS OVER DETECTED LINES

=========FOURTH=========
FIND LINES USING HOUGHT

FOR LINES DETECTED DETERMINE "K"(y=k*x+b) AND USING KNN COMPARE "K" AND DELETE 
FROM VECTOR THOSE WHOSE "K" DIVERSE MORE THAN EPS

INTERPOLATE PIXELS OVER OTHERS LINES

=========FIFTH=========
Hought line detector with gib enought (variable) last parametr

find interceptions of lines, if line has more than two -> ignore line

INTERPOLATE PIXELS OVER DETECTED LINES (USE RoiFill)


=========FIGURES DETECTION=========
http://opencv-srf.blogspot.com/2011/09/object-detection-tracking-using-contours.html
find nuber of corners (if 3; if 4 etc.)
else run Hought circle detector with iteration of radiuces
